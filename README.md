# LOCAL WEATHER APP
This project uses the Geolocation API to get the geographical position of the user as well as the Fetch API to retrieve the current weather data, and displays a responsive web design.

The Local Weather App first discovers the user's location, then queries the Open Weather Map for the current weather conditions at the user's location and subsequently displays the results.
